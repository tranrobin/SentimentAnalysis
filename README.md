# SentimentAnalysis
This is a Python script that demonstrates text classification using the PhoBERT language model and a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier. The code loads a pre-trained PhoBERT model to extract features from text data and then trains a Naive Bayes classifier on the extracted features. The trained model can be saved for future use.
